Got 13/15

Comment:
Dear Wei,
We appreciate your submission for the assignment 1.
Overall, your submission is excellent. Most of the basic requirements are working properly. A server UI with logs is nice, but dictionary persistent shouldnâ€™t require manual click of a button. Servers are often not attended. Help docs, client query history and additional operations are all good features to have.

For the improvement of your application or similar ones in the future, please consider the following points:

For a better user experience, if the server occasionally needs to shut down or restart, auto recovery/reconnect mechanism shall be in-place. 

Code quality is excellent.

The submitted report contains required basic content, and the quality of your report is excellent.

In addition, there are a few issues:

Persistence is a basic requirement; the data needs to be stored whether the server is properly shutdown or somehow crashed.

Based on your extra feature implementation, we are awarding some extra marks.

Overall,
8/10 for basic requirements.
5/5 for advanced implementation, report/code quality and excellence.

Your mark is 13 based on the above assessment.
